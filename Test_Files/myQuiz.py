import budget; print(budget.calcBills())


"""

Before the above code was displayed, two other attempts were made; Here were their results:
For "import budget", the shell was empty as all we did was imported the budget module without calling it.
For "import budget; print(calcBills())", we attempted to call the function but did not specify which module to call it from.
For "import budget; print(budget.calcBills())", this syntax worked successfully because it calls a function from a targeted module.
