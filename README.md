## Student Tracker
This project was designed using tkinter tools to create a GUI that allows the user to create a student with their course info. This will be stored into an sqlite3 database for CRUD operations.

## Phonebook Application
Project created through video tutorials using tkinter modules also. Functionality similar to the student tracker app in that the user can create a phone record for an individual and store it into a database for later use.

## Web_Browser_GUI
This project was a challenge given from The Tech Academy where I was tasked to create an app using tkinter that displays a GUI for the user to write the body of a basic HTML page that will create and display their webpage in their default browser once completed. 

## Django_University
A project created in PyCharm that uses Django to create a basic app that can add, modify, and delete students from the University database both from the PyCharm terminal and the admin site.

## Django_Banking
A Django challenge that tracks account transactions from current members of the Bluebird Bank and displays their current balance after all transactions have been completed.
